This project is proudly using emoji data from the [Emoji One](http://emojione.com/) project.

## Installation

Installation is optional, but recommended to run the program at session startup easily. 

### Method 1: Install Debian Package from PPA

This method requires root access and is only available for Ubuntu 14.04, 15.10 and 16.04 at this moment.

  1. Add [Official PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ys/+archive/ubuntu/emojione-picker): `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ys/emojione-picker`
  2. Reload package indexes: `sudo apt-get update`
  3. Install package: `sudo apt-get install emojione-picker`

### Method 2: Build a Debian Package from source

This method requires root access and was only tested on Ubuntu 14.04, 15.10 and 16.04, but should work on any Debian-based distribution.

  1. Install dependencies: `sudo apt-get install python-2.7 python-all-dev build-essential python-notify gir1.2-notify-0.7 gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 gir1.2-rsvg-2.0`
  2. Clone the repository and cd into it: `git clone https://github.com/gentakojima/emojione-picker-ubuntu; cd emojione-picker-ubuntu`
  3. Checkout the latest stable release. List the available releases: `git tag -l` and checkout, for example: `git checkout v0.1` (you can ignore this step to build the current development version instead, that may or may not work properly).
  4. Build the package: `debuild` (*Signing the package might fail at this point, but it's not a big deal*)
  5. Install it! `sudo dpkg -i ../emojione-picker*.deb`

### Method 3: Standalone installer (should work on any distro!)

This method does not require root access. If you run it as root, the picker will be installed for all users.

  1. Clone the repository and cd into it: `git clone https://github.com/gentakojima/emojione-picker-ubuntu; cd emojione-picker-ubuntu`
  2. Checkout the latest stable release. List the available releases: `git tag -l` and checkout, for example: `git checkout v0.1` (you can ignore this step to build the current development version instead, that may or may not work properly).
  3. Run `./install.sh`
  4. If you want to uninstall it later, just run `./install.sh` again.

## How to run it

If you installed it, the picker should be started on a fresh session start. Just close your current session, and start it again.

If you want to manually run it right now, just press `Alt+F2` and write the command `emojione-picker`. If you used the standalone installer and installed it just for the current user, you might need to specify the path to the program, that is `~/.local/bin/emojione-picker`.

## Troubleshooting issues

The indicator usually takes 3 to 5 seconds to load, but it can take up to 30 seconds in older computers. In *Settings*, enable the option *Low end computer mode* to reduce the number of menu items (and emojis). That should speed up loading time. Currently, this mode shows about 1100 emojis out of 1700, but I intend to lower that to about 900 in the future.

## How to use it

  1. Choose your emoji from the dropdown menu.
  2. Paste it (usually `Ctrl+V`) wherever you want!

## License

The code is probably poisoned by the GPL somehow, and I'm too lazy to check it. So be it, this will be licensed as GNU GPL v3. You know, *that* license. Check your smart TV or your toaster manual for a printed copy.

## FAQ

### Why for Ubuntu only? Does this work with KDE and other distros?

Of course, but it was designed to work with the Unity desktop. It's been reported to work with Cinnamon, XFCE, Openbox (with Stalonetray and Tint2), Gnome Shell, MATE and KDE.

Unfortunately, Cinnamon implementation won't show the content of submenus if the total height is bigger than the screen height.

### When I paste all/some icons, they are shown as ugly boxes. I want my money back!

Recent GNU/Linux distributions (including Ubuntu 14.04, 15.10) won't display emojis properly out of the box.

You can get full color emojis working on Firefox with black and white fallback for other applications following these instructions: https://github.com/eosrei/emojione-color-font

### I get "ValueError: Namespace AppIndicator3 not available" at startup

You're missing the required python library. Please install the required package:
  - Ubuntu: `gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1`
  - OpenSuse Leap: `typelib-1_0-AppIndicator3-0_1`
